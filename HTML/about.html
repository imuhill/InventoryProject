<h1><b>About the Inventory Management System</b></h1>
<p>The Inventory Management System is a project dedicated to creating a functional database 
    for maintaining an accurate count of Computer Science and Electrical Engineerng items needed
    for the freshmen class at Houston Baptist University. This system will make it easier for 
    falculty and staff to input the necessary data within the click of a button! Falculty and 
    staff will have easy access to add an item, modify the count of an item, and delete an item.
    All of the information will be automatically updated and saved to a MySQL database. This is 
    a major upgrade from entering and saving data manually from an Excel sheet.</p>


<h1><b>Contributors</b></h1>
<p>This project was created by two junior Computer science students, Brian Davis and I'munique Hill, 
    for the Programming Languages for Web Development (COSC 3353) course.</p>
